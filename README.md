# How to Make Your Personalized or Targeted Advertising Less Creepy


More and more people are creeped out by the level of personalization in marketing and advertising. Here's how to reach them without scaring them.
These days, it’s not uncommon to hear conversations around targeted advertising or digital personalization tinged with unease or concern.
Are social platforms listening to our conversations?
How do they know my name?
What even is this product from Wish.com and why is it being advertised to me?
It’s not to say that the concerns aren’t legitimate. After all, the idea of massive corporations buying our data can be uncomfortable.
But the sentiment around targeted advertising doesn’t necessarily reflect how effective they are.
Do we think personalization and hyper-targeted advertising is creepy?
Sure.
Also, though, we mostly notice when things aren’t functioning the way they should, like every time autocorrect thinks I mean “ducking.”
But if everything is going smoothly, what’s to notice at all?
This is why it’s more important than ever that advertisers do the heavy lifting of figuring out who their audience is with data and formalize these audiences with actual, documented buyer personas.
Only with a laser-focused understanding of your audience will you be able to use personalization and targeted advertising that doesn’t upset your potential customer.

Here are a few ways to make sure your personalization and advertising efforts are more effective than they are jarring.

Instead, I’ve seen too many brands (even very large organizations) who start their advertising efforts based on a barely-laced-together specter of a buyer, typically grounded in only one person’s vision of who the customer is.

For example, I’ve worked for very large tech organizations who decided that their buyer personas were two white men, each of them had the same stereotypical “techie” attributes, except one of them enjoyed video games and the other enjoyed flying first class.
